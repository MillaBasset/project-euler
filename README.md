# project-euler
My Project Euler solutions - most will be in Lua. Some may be in a different language if it is easier to use for the problem, though.

## DISCLAIMER
This repository will contain spoilers - you have been warned!  
You can try Project Euler yourself for free [here](https://projecteuler.net).  
I'm probably going to upload my solutions in bulk, instead of uploading them individually. Don't be surprised if this repository has periodic inactivity.
