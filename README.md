# project-euler
My Project Euler solutions - most will be in Lua. Some may be in a different language if it is easier to use for the problem, though.

## DISCLAIMER
This repository will contain spoilers - you have been warned!  
You can try Project Euler yourself for free [here](https://projecteuler.net).  
I might upload my solutions individually or in bulk - it really depends. Expect periodic inactivity.
